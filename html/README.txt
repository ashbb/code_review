This subdirectory is used to store .html files created by the tool: mkhtml.rb and mkbightml.rb

Run the following command line on the console (terminal) window.

  C:\> ruby mkhtml.rb
  C:\> ruby mkbightml.rb

Then they'll create .html files here.

You can read whole eBook offline.
And you can run whole sample codes, too. :-D
